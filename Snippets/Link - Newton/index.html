            <p> The most important philosopher of all-time. Newton was plagued by the loss of family and place in family
                life.
                Newton had no heirs, few friends and many rivals but one blasphemous ambition: The pursuit of knowledge
                and the contemplation of "Doubt". The skew of Sir Newton was knowledge of the why of and where for and
                by the account of many historians was a contradiction of a man.
                Pious yet pagan; Astronomer yet astrologic; Mathmatician yet Naturalist and finally Alchemist yet
                Scientific.
                He was a religious doubtful philosopher who questioned God and the observable world.
